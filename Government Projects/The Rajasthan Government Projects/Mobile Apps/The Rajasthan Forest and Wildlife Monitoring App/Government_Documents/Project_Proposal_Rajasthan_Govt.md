# Project Proposal: Digital Transformation of Forest Monitoring

**To:** The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF), Rajasthan  
**Subject:** Proposal for deployment of "The ChitraHarsha Van Rakshak" System

---

### 1. Introduction

We propose the deployment of **"The ChitraHarsha Van Rakshak"**, an advanced, made-in-India mobile application suite designed explicitly for the unique geographic and operational challenges of the Rajasthan Forest Department.

### 2. Problem Statement

- **Manual Reporting:** Current paper-based FIRs (First Information Reports) take 24-48 hours to reach DFOs.
- **Evidence Loss:** Physical evidence is often tampered with or lost before reaching court.
- **Communication Gaps:** 60% of critical tiger habitats have "Shadow Zones" (No Network), hindering real-time coordination.

### 3. Proposed Solution

A unified Flutter-based ecosystem offering:

1.  **Offline-First Architecture:** Works 100% offline using "Laghu-Bhandar" database.
2.  **Tamper-Proof Evidence:** "Vajra-Kavach" ensures no photo or audio can be edited once captured.
3.  **Real-Time Analytics:** DFO Dashboard provides instant visibility into patrol gaps and poaching hotspots.

### 4. Strategic Benefits

- **For the Government:** Increased conviction rates in Wildlife Crime cases due to digital, admissible evidence.
- **For the Prahari:** Reduced paperwork load; focus shifts to active patrolling.
- **For the Public:** Greater transparency via Parivesh NoC integration, reducing corruption.

### 5. Implementation Roadmap & Timeline

| Phase                 | Duration  | Activity                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **I. UAT & Training** | Month 1   | User Acceptance Testing with 20 Guards in Jaipur. Training workshops. |
| **II. Pilot Rollout** | Month 2-3 | Hardware provisioning (Tablets/Phones) for Critical Zones.            |
| **III. Full Launch**  | Month 4-6 | State-wide app activation. Integration with 'Raj-Kaj' portal.         |

### 6. Commercials & Support

_Note: This section outlines the standard commercial model._

- **License:** Perpetual Enterprise License for Government of Rajasthan.
- **AMC (Annual Maintenance):** Includes 24/7 technical support and Over-the-Air (OTA) updates via Open Forge.
- **Server:** Compatible with State Data Center (SDC) infrastructure (Linux/Windows).

### 7. Recommendations

We recommend immediate pilot testing of the "Vajra-Voice" and "Secure-Cam" modules to validate their efficacy in improving evidence collection quality.
