# Contributing to Raj Kissan Organic (OpenForge Rajasthan) 🤝

We welcome collaboration from the Rajasthan technical community to make this the "World's Most Powerful" agricultural platform.

---

## 1. OpenForge Standards

All contributions must follow the **Rajasthan Government OpenForge** collaborative guidelines.

## 2. Hyper-Scale Development Focus

We are particularly interested in contributions related to:

- **L10n**: Expanding the "Vaani-Bhasha" NLP dictionary for localized Rajasthani dialects.
- **Edge-AI**: Optimizing the Krishi-Sarathi module for ultra-low-power devices.
- **MeghKosh Connectors**: Integrating with additional state departments (Irrigation, Animal Husbandry).

## 3. Security Protocols

- **NO Plaintext**: All data handling must use the `CloudAdapter.secureVault()` protocols.
- **Audit Requirement**: Any change to the 10-Trillion Scale Indexing logic requires a mandatory audit by the ChitraHarsha Technical Directorate.

## 4. Code of Conduct

Respect for the farming community is paramount. All UI/UX changes must prioritize "Inclusivity" and "Simplicity" for rural users.
