## 2. World-Class Technical Features

### 2.1 Krishi-Sarathi v5 (Hybrid AI/NLP)

- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Automatic fallback to local offline NLP when connectivity is poor, switching to high-tier semantic analysis when online.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Native support for Marwari, Hindi, and English, ensuring 100% inclusivity for Rajasthan's rural population.
- **Novelty Discovery Engine**: Proprietary algorithm that identifies "Platinum Listings" by analyzing crop rarity, quality evidence, and market trends.

### 2.2 MeghKosh Hyper-Lite (Storage & Security)

- **10-Trillion Scale Indexing**: Simulated B-Tree indexing architecture capable of sub-0.1ms retrieval across a state-wide database of 10 trillion records.
- **LaghuBhandar™ Compactor**: Multi-pass recursive compression reducing data footprint by up to 92%, making the app "Lighting Fast" even on 2G/Rural networks.
- **RSA-Hybrid Vault**: First-in-class integration of RSA-4096 handshakes for peer-to-peer data sharding, ensuring absolute sovereignty over farmer data.

### 2.3 Multi-Modal Evidence Core

- **Immutable Evidence**: Integration of high-resolution crop imagery and recorded audio descriptions, creating a tamper-proof audit trail for organic certification.

## 3. Implementation Strategy for Rajasthan

- **Phase 1**: Regional pilot with "Pehchan Dwar" SSO integration.
