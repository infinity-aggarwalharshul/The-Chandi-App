## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛡️ For Field Units (Van Prahari)

- **Biometric Authentication**: Secure login simulating biometric access for designated field officers.
- **Apradh Panjiyan (Secure Offense Log)**: Real-time logging of forest offenses (wood cutting, poaching, encroachment) with AES-256 encryption.
- **Drishti AI™ Bio-Scan**: Advanced AI module for analyzing biological evidence and identifying species/threats on the edge.
- **Gasti Path (Offline GIS)**: Fully functional offline mapping system for zones with zero connectivity (Dark Zones).
- **Aapat-Kaal (SOS)**: Instant emergency broadcast system with geo-fencing capabilities.

### 🏢 For Command Center (DFO/Admin)

- **Live 10T Grid Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of forest health, patrol units, and incident feeds.
- **Parivesh NoC Tracker**: Integrated tracking of No-Objection Certificates for development projects (Solar Parks, Roads), aligned with MoEFCC guidelines.
- **IoT Sensor Grid**: Monitoring of seismic and acoustic sensors for detecting illegal mining or logging.
- **Roster Management**: Digital duty allocation for patrol beats (Sariska, Ranthambore, Keoladeo, etc.).

## 📜 Compliance & Legal Framework

This software is designed strictly in adhering to the statutory frameworks of the **Government of Rajasthan** and **Government of India**:

- **The Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953**: Digital logging conforms to the evidentiary requirements for forest offenses.
- **The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972**: Species classification and offense categorization align with Schedules I-IV.
- **Information Technology Act, 2000**: Data handling and encryption comply with Section 43A (SPDI Rules).
- **Rajasthan Guaranteed Delivery of Public Services Act, 2011**: Ensures timely processing of NoC applications tracked via the dashboard.
