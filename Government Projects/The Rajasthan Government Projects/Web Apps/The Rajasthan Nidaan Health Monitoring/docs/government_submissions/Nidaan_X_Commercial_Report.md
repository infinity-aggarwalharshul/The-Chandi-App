## 1. Executive Summary: The Future is Here

We are proud to present **Nidaan X**, a quantum leap in health surveillance technology. Updates from Version 2.0 to Version 3.0 transform this application from a state-level tool to a **Global Health Intelligence Platform** capable of handling exabyte-scale data with offline-first AI.

## 2. World-Class "Power" Features

### 🧠 Divya-Drishti 3.0 (Hybrid AI Engine)

- **Zero-Latency Inference:** Unlike cloud-only AI, our engine runs directly on the device using WebAssembly technology.
- **Dynamic Learning:** The system checks for "Intelligence Module Updates" every time it connects, ensuring it can detect _new_ viruses (like a new COVID variant) within hours of global discovery.
- **Novelty:** Includes "Risk Pulse" visualization for immediate triage.

### 💾 Anant-Kosh (Quantum-DB Architecture)

- **10 Trillion Scale:** Designed with a sharding architecture compatible with BigQuery/Snowflake.
- **Simulated Infinite Storage:** The browser client uses an optimized, compressed "Shard" capability to store months of data offline without slowing down.
- **Light & Fast:** Despite the power, the core bundle is <500KB thanks to advanced tree-shaking and lazy loading.

### 🗣️ Natural Language Genius

- **Code-Switching NLP:** Understands mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish) commands natively.
- **Context Awareness:** "Save this record" understands _which_ patient is currently active.
