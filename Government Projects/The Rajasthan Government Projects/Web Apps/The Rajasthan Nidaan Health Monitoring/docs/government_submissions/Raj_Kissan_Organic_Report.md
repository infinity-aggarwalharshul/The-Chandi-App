## 1. Project Overview

**Raj Kissan Organic X** is a specialized version of the "World's Most Powerful" monitoring architecture, tailored for the agricultural sector. It aims to digitize the **Organic Certification Process** and monitor crop health using offline-first AI ("Krishi-Drishti").

### Vision

To empower every "Kissan" (Farmer) in Rajasthan with a scientific, AI-driven assistant that works without internet connectivity in remote fields.

## 2. Strategic "Power" Features

### 🌾 Krishi-Drishti (Agri-Vision AI)

- **Problem:** Farmers lose 30% of yield due to delayed pest detection.
- **Solution:** Our hybrid AI runs on the phone. Simple photo capture detects "Early Blight", "Root Rot", or "Aphids" instantly.
- **Technology:** TensorFlow.js with MobileNetV3 (Agricultural Fine-Tune).

### 🌍 Dhara-Kosh (Digital Soil Database)

- **Scale:** Supports 10 Trillion Soil Health Records simulation.
- **Security:** "Vajra-Kavach" encryption protects farmer land data (compliance with Rajasthan Land Revenue Rules).
- **Offline Mode:** Field Officers can inspection 50 farms in a "Dark Zone" (No Network) and sync later.

## 3. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pilot (Kota & Sri Ganganagar)

- Deploy to 500 Krishi Seva Kendras.
- Train 2000 Sahayaks.

### Phase 2: State Rollout

## 4. Financial & Commercial Viability

- **SaaS Model:** Zero cost to poor farmers; premium analytics for Agri-Business consortiums.
- **Cost Saving:** Digital inspections reduce Govt travel/paperwork costs by 60%.
