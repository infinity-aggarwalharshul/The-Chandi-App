# PROJECT PROPOSAL

## Deployment of "Nidaan 2.0 AI" Across Rajasthan State Healthcare Network

**To:**
The Principal Secretary,
Department of Medical, Health & Family Welfare,
Government of Rajasthan, Secretariat, Jaipur.

**From:**
The ChitraHarsha VPK Ventures
(Technology Partner for Digital Rajasthan)

**Subject:** Proposal for Statewide Rollout of AI-Powered Offline-First Health Monitoring System.

---

### 1. Introduction

We maintain that **"Health is the Wealth of the State."** To realize the vision of a **"Nirogi Rajasthan"**, we propose the statewide deployment of **The ChitraHarsha Nidaan 2.0 AI**. This application is not just a digital tool but a comprehensive health surveillance ecosystem designed to empower our grassroots health workers (ASHAs, ANMs, and CHC/PHC staff).

### 2. Problem Statement

Despite robust healthcare infrastructure, Rajasthan faces unique challenges:

- **Geographical Barriers:** Remote hamlets in desert and tribal areas face connectivity issues, leading to delays in reporting health data.
- **Data Latency:** Manual compilation of registers leads to a lag of 10-15 days in disease trend analysis.
- **Language Barrier:** Complex English-based apps are difficult for some rural field workers to operate efficiently.
- **Data Security:** Increasing cyber threats require military-grade protection for citizen health data.

### 3. Our Solution: Nidaan 2.0 AI

We have developed a commercially ready, future-proof solution that addresses these challenges head-on:

- **Offline Capability:** Works seamlessly without internet. Data syncs automatically when the worker returns to a network zone (PHC/CHC).
- **Voice-First Interface:** Workers can simply **speak** symptoms in Hindi or local dialects to enter data, removing the typing barrier.
- **Integrated Diagnostics:** The **Netra Lens** feature uses the phone's camera to assist in identifying symptoms, digitizing records, and even recording patient audio for doctor review.
- **Secure & Compliant:** Built with **AES-256-GCM encryption**, ensuring that patient data is unreadable to anyone except authorized personnel. Fully compliant with **DPDP Act 2023**.

### 4. Value Proposition to Government of Rajasthan

#### A. Enhanced Disease Surveillance

The "Divya-Drishti" prediction engine analyzes incoming data to predict outbreaks (e.g., "High correlation of fever cases in Barmer Block A") _before_ they become epidemics.

#### B. Cost & Resource Efficiency

- **Paperless Operations:** Saves crores annually in printing and logistics.
- **Targeted Intervention:** Real-time data allows for precise dispatch of medicines and fogging teams, preventing wastage.

#### C. Empowerment of Field Workers

Empowering 50,000+ ASHAs/ANMs with a tool that understands their voice and works on basic smartphones increases their efficiency and job satisfaction.

### 5. Implementation Roadmap Strategy

| Phase        | Timeline  | Activity                                                      |
| :----------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pilot**    | Month 1-2 | Deployment in 2 Districts (1 Desert, 1 Tribal) for UAT.       |
| **Training** | Month 3   | Master Trainer sessions for CMHOs and Block Program Managers. |
| **Phase I**  | Month 4-6 | Rollout in 10 High-Priority Districts.                        |
| **Phase II** | Month 7-9 | Statewide rollout to all 33/50 Districts.                     |
| **Handover** | Month 12  | Complete transfer of source code and admin control to DoIT&C. |

### 6. Requirement for Commercial Launch

To proceed with the formal launch, we request:

1.  **Administrative Approval** for pilot deployment.
2.  **Integration Access** to Raj-Net/SDC for server hosting (or approval to continue with secure Cloud).
3.  **Nomination** of a Nodal Officer from the NHM (National Health Mission) Rajasthan.

### 7. Conclusion

**Nidaan 2.0 AI** is ready to serve the people of Rajasthan. It combines the empathy of human care with the precision of Artificial Intelligence. We eagerly await your approval to help build a healthier, digital-first Rajasthan.
